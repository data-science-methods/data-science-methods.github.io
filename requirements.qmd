# Prerequisites

This course assumes **basic competence** with **introductory R**. 

"Introductory R" 
 ~ Lessons 1-5 of the Carpentries ["R for Social Scientists"](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/) curriculum

    - Installing R and packages
    - Working in the R Studio IDE
    - Common data types
    - Reading and writing CSV files
    - Tidyverse R:  `mutate()`, `filter()`, `select()`; plotting with `ggplot2`

"Basic competence"
 ~ Given time and a reference ([cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/), Stack Exchange, mentor) you can figure out how to solve a problem

# Pedagogical note

This course uses a version of [contract grading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_grading).  This means: 

- Your grade will be determined by the work you complete, not an assessment of the quality of your work. 
- There are only two possible grades: completed (A) and incomplete (B).  
    - In exceptional cases, eg, almost no work completed, I might also assign a failing grade.  
    
Contract grading was originally developed in writing courses, where the primary goal was to align grading with explicit ("objective") measures of effort or productivity rather than tacit ("subjective") measures of quality.  Simply practicing writing a lot is more valuable for most undergraduate students than trying to write well.  Contract grading also simplifies the grading process.  

I hate the term "contract grading," which reinforces the idea that education is a commodity that you, the student, are purchasing from me, the teacher.  The student-written "contract" of contract grading also seems basically unnecessary.
