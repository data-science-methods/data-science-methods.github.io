The usual

## Soft deadlines

Until the end of term, all deadlines are soft, with no penalties for turning in assignments a few days late.  Labs have a soft deadline  of 2 weeks for an initial submission, with an additional week to revise & resubmit as necessary to satisfy the automatic checks. 

::: aside
I've found soft deadlines work well for about 80% students, who need the flexibility to handle ::gestures at the entire state of everything::.  **If soft deadlines don't work well for you, treat the soft deadlines as hard deadlines.**  I will also try to follow up with you if I notice you're missing a lot of earlier work.

This course uses a version of [contract grading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_grading).  This means: 

- Your grade will be determined by the work you complete, not an assessment of the quality of your work. 
- There are only two possible grades: completed (A) and incomplete (B).  
    - In exceptional cases, eg, almost no work completed, I might also assign a failing grade.  
    
::: aside
Contract grading was originally developed in writing courses, where the primary goal was to align grading with explicit ("objective") measures of effort or productivity rather than tacit ("subjective") measures of quality.  Simply practicing writing a lot is more valuable for most undergraduate students than trying to write well.  Contract grading also simplifies the grading process.  

I hate the term "contract grading," which reinforces the idea that education is a commodity that you, the student, are purchasing from me, the teacher.  The student-written "contract" of contract grading also seems basically unnecessary.
